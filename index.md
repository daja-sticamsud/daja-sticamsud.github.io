## Detection strategies based on Software Metrics for Multitier JavaScript (DAJA)

DAJA is a project of the Regional Program STIC-AmSud. The DAJA project will extend the state-of-the-Art in software quality for the JavaScript ecosystem. In particular, DAJA will reach the following goals:
- Provide meta-modeling and visualization techniques to analyze the static and dynamic structure of JavaScript applications. Our approach will be tunable and easily customizable to focus on a particular domain when necessary.
- Identify and characterize recurrent situations in JavaScript source code leading to software code anomalies (_i.e.,_ static or dynamic suboptimal structure) and vulnerable code.
- Conduct relevant experiments over an adequate and representative subset of the JavaScript ecosystem, including analyzing software systems and conducting experiments involving developers (considering open and close source code). In particular, our approach will be available to Hop.js, an extension of JavaScript.
- Provide software artifacts to make our results accessible to the software engineering community. The resulting tools will be released under an open source license.
