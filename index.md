## Detection strategies based on Software Metrics for Multitier JavaScript (DAJA)

DAJA is a project of the Regional Program STIC-AmSud. The DAJA project will extend the state-of-the-Art in software quality for the JavaScript ecosystem. In particular, DAJA will reach the following goals:
- Provide meta-modeling and visualization techniques to analyze the static and dynamic structure of JavaScript applications. Our approach will be tunable and easily customizable to focus on a particular domain when necessary.
- Identify and characterize recurrent situations in JavaScript source code leading to software code anomalies (_i.e.,_ static or dynamic suboptimal structure) and vulnerable code.
- Conduct relevant experiments over an adequate and representative subset of the JavaScript ecosystem, including analyzing software systems and conducting experiments involving developers (considering open and close source code). In particular, our approach will be available to Hop.js, an extension of JavaScript.
- Provide software artifacts to make our results accessible to the software engineering community. The resulting tools will be released under an open source license.



### Participants
Three institutions are part of DAJA:
- University of Chile
- UNICEN University
- INRIA Nice Sophia Antipolis


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/daja-sticamsud/daja-sticamsud.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/daja-sticamsud/daja-sticamsud.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
